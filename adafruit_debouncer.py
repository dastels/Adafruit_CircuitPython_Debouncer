`adafruit_debouncer`
====================================================

Debounces an arbitrary predicate function (typically created as a lambda) of 0 arguments.
Since a very common use is debouncing a digital input pin, the initializer accepts a pin number
instead of a lambda.

* Author(s): Dave Astels
